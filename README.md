# AI_EnvironmentalLighting

This is a bit of a niche mod.  It is mainly intended for people that like to use DHH in the main game, but hate that it messes with the in game day/night light cycle.  DHH replaces some of the ambient/direct light that changes depending on time of day and position of the sun/moon with a static light source.  This causes the night, and especially the moon light to be way too bright.  The mod restores the in game lighting to its normal behavior, but lets you use all of the other really neat features of DHH like color balancing.

This mod also adds some other features that work with or without DHH.  These features give you more control over the environmental lighting to adjust them as you see fit.  These features include:

Automatically blends the day light and moon light settings.  Normally in game there is a harsh transition from day light to moon light that you can see, this blends the transition so it looks like a more natural sunrise/sunset.

Allow you to control what style of ambient light to use, so you can swith to Skybox or Trilight (default) if you choose.  Skybox mode automatically calculates ambient light based off of the time of day.

Increases the number of skybox calculations during dawn/dusk.  The default settings don't update rapidly enough during this transition period.

Independet contols of daytime and nighttime ambient light with blending between the day/night cycles.

Allows modifications to the direct sun and moon light settings.  Unlike DHH, these modify the base values instead of replace so it still follows the in game light calculations.
