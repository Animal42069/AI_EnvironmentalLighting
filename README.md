# AI_EnvironmentalLighting

This is a bit of a niche mod.  It only runs in the main game, and is designed to adjust some of the lighting effects in the game to achieve a more natural looking environment.  It is intended to work alongside Graphics Mod (recommended), or DHH.  These features give you more control over the environmental lighting to adjust them as you see fit.  These features include:

Automatically blends the day light and moon light settings.  Normally in game there is a harsh transition from day light to moon light that you can see, this blends the transition so it looks like a more natural sunrise/sunset.

Allow you to control what style of ambient light to use, so you can swith to Skybox or Trilight (default) if you choose.  Skybox mode is not recommended since it does not factor in weather effects.

Increases the number of skybox calculations during dawn/dusk.  The default settings don't update rapidly enough during this transition period.

Independent contols of daytime and nighttime ambient light with blending between the day/night cycles.

Allows modifications to the direct sun and moon light settings.  Unlike DHH, these modify the base values instead of replace so it still follows the in game light calculations.

Option to override DHH lighting, since DHH lighting overrides the normal game light calculations this allows you to restore them.

Allows modification to sunlight/moonlight intensity and shadow strength depending on the current weather.  The game only factors in ambient light for weather effects.  This allows you to reduct the light and shadows when it is storming out for a more realistic effect.

Allows a global modification to the light color of all natural fire light on the map.  In my opinion, all of the fires have too much of a red component to them.  This allows you to adjust the color components to achieve a more natural looking light.

Allows modification to the light color of handheld and waist natural fire lights.  Same as above, in my opinion they are normally too red.
